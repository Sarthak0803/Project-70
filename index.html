                                •Technology in the 21st century is an integral part of society. It is constantly evolving and it is impossible to think of life without the usage of some form of technology. However, technology can be both a blessing and a curse; in a digital world, we have to be prepared to segregate the vast amount of information available, identify what is relevant and use it appropriately.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                •Technology potential for educational purposes is expanding exponentially, as is evidenced by ever- new concepts of teaching via technology. With its wide range of uses and forms, it can reach students of different growth levels. Computers are used as tools for instructional material or as presentation devices to provide information. It definitely enhances the learning capacity of students. The children are more enthusiastic about learning through technological devices than through the traditional teaching techniques.

                                <br>
                                •Niraj International School makes judicious use of the current educational technology with a variety of multimedia tools as effective learning aids. The flexibility of the infrastructure at NIS is particularly valuable within the classroom or laboratory, where seating plans and furniture distribution change constantly, to reflect the multiple needs of the curriculum. The school server maintains a broadband connection throughout the year. The Computer Lab is open to anyone wishing to use the School’s technology. Our credo of Anywhere – Anytime learning, gives students the opportunity to connect to the School’s internet server from their laptops from anywhere in the campus. Additionally, our helpful teachers are always available to clear the student’s doubts to reinforce the impact of the digital learning.

                                •Technology has its place in every curricular subject. In the Science Laboratory, students can perform controlled experiments under the watchful guidance of teachers. They can also use computing software imaginatively in different fields like science, languages, music and the arts. The superbly equipped Library and Media Centre includes a Distance – Learning Studio which provides access - to students and staff alike - to a wealth of knowledge from some of the best universities in the world. Additionally, the School has a centrally computerized information management system that facilitates parents to keep track of their children’s progress.
